## Installation

**Note**: If you want to both produce and consume messages, please use [Karafka](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/). It integrates WaterDrop automatically.

Add this to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'waterdrop'
```

and run

```
bundle install
```

## Setup

WaterDrop is a complex tool that contains multiple configuration options. To keep everything organized, all the configuration options were divided into two groups:

- WaterDrop options - options directly related to WaterDrop and its components
- Kafka driver options - options related to `rdkafka`

To apply all those configuration options, you need to create a producer instance and use the ```#setup``` method:

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new

producer.setup do |config|
  config.deliver = true
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'request.required.acks': 1
  }
end
```

or you can do the same while initializing the producer:

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  config.deliver = true
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'request.required.acks': 1
  }
end
```

### WaterDrop configuration options

| Option             | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | id of the producer for instrumentation and logging              |
| `logger`           | Logger that we want to use                                      |
| `deliver`          | Should we send messages to Kafka or just fake the delivery      |
| `max_wait_timeout` | Waits that long for the delivery report or raises an error      |
| `wait_timeout`     | Waits that long before re-check of delivery report availability |

### Kafka configuration options

You can create producers with different `kafka` settings. Documentation of the available configuration options is available on https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md.

## Usage

### Basic usage

To send Kafka messages, just create a producer and use it:

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new

producer.setup do |config|
  config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092' }
end

producer.produce_sync(topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message')

# or for async
producer.produce_async(topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message')

# or in batches
producer.produce_many_sync(
  [
    { topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message'},
    { topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message'}
  ]
)

# both sync and async
producer.produce_many_async(
  [
    { topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message'},
    { topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message'}
  ]
)

# Don't forget to close the producer once you're done to flush the internal buffers, etc
producer.close
```

Each message that you want to publish, will have its value checked.

Here are all the things you can provide in the message hash:

| Option          | Required | Value type    | Description                                              |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `topic`         | true     | String        | The Kafka topic that should be written to                |
| `payload`       | true     | String        | Data you want to send to Kafka                           |
| `key`           | false    | String        | The key that should be set in the Kafka message          |
| `partition`     | false    | Integer       | A specific partition number that should be written to    |
| `partition_key` | false    | String        | Key to indicate the destination partition of the message |
| `timestamp`     | false    | Time, Integer | The timestamp that should be set on the message          |
| `headers`       | false    | Hash          | Headers for the message                                  |

Keep in mind, that message you want to send should be either binary or stringified (to_s, to_json, etc).

### Using WaterDrop across the application and with Ruby on Rails

If you plan to both produce and consume messages using Kafka, you should install and use [Karafka](https://github.com/karafka/karafka). It integrates automatically with Ruby on Rails applications and auto-configures WaterDrop producer to make it accessible via `Karafka#producer` method.

If you want to only produce messages from within your application, since WaterDrop is thread-safe you can create a single instance in an initializer like so:

```ruby
KAFKA_PRODUCER = WaterDrop::Producer.new

KAFKA_PRODUCER.setup do |config|
  config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092' }
end

# And just dispatch messages
KAFKA_PRODUCER.produce_sync(topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message')
```

### Using WaterDrop with a connection-pool

While WaterDrop is thread-safe, there is no problem in using it with a connection pool inside high-intensity applications. The only thing worth keeping in mind, is that WaterDrop instances should be shutdown before the application is closed.

```ruby
KAFKA_PRODUCERS_CP = ConnectionPool.new do
  WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
    config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092' }
  end
end

KAFKA_PRODUCERS_CP.with do |producer|
  producer.produce_async(topic: 'my-topic', payload: 'my message')
end

KAFKA_PRODUCERS_CP.shutdown { |producer| producer.close }
```

### Buffering

WaterDrop producers support buffering messages in their internal buffers and on the `rdkafka` level via `queue.buffering.*` set of settings.

This means that depending on your use case, you can achieve both granular buffering and flushing control when needed with context awareness and periodic and size-based flushing functionalities.

#### Using WaterDrop to buffer messages based on the application logic

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new

producer.setup do |config|
  config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092' }
end

# Simulating some events states of a transaction - notice, that the messages will be flushed to
# kafka only upon arrival of the `finished` state.
%w[
  started
  processed
  finished
].each do |state|
  producer.buffer(topic: 'events', payload: state)

  puts "The messages buffer size #{producer.messages.size}"
  producer.flush_sync if state == 'finished'
  puts "The messages buffer size #{producer.messages.size}"
end

producer.close
```

#### Using WaterDrop with rdkafka buffers to achieve periodic auto-flushing

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new

producer.setup do |config|
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    # Accumulate messages for at most 10 seconds
    'queue.buffering.max.ms': 10_000
  }
end

# WaterDrop will flush messages minimum once every 10 seconds
30.times do |i|
  producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: i.to_s)
  sleep(1)
end

producer.close
```

## Instrumentation

Each of the producers after the `#setup` is done, has a custom monitor to which you can subscribe.

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new

producer.setup do |config|
  config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092' }
end

producer.monitor.subscribe('message.produced_async') do |event|
  puts "A message was produced to '#{event[:message][:topic]}' topic!"
end

producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: 'data')

producer.close
```

See the `WaterDrop::Instrumentation::Monitor::EVENTS` for the list of all the supported events.

### Usage statistics

WaterDrop may be configured to emit internal metrics at a fixed interval by setting the `kafka` `statistics.interval.ms` configuration property to a value > `0`. Once that is done, emitted statistics are available after subscribing to the `statistics.emitted` publisher event.

The statistics include all of the metrics from `librdkafka` (full list [here](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/STATISTICS.md)) as well as the diff of those against the previously emitted values.

For several attributes like `txmsgs`, `librdkafka` publishes only the totals. In order to make it easier to track the progress (for example number of messages sent between statistics emitted events), WaterDrop diffs all the numeric values against previously available numbers. All of those metrics are available under the same key as the metric but with additional `_d` postfix:


```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'statistics.interval.ms': 2_000 # emit statistics every 2 seconds
  }
end

producer.monitor.subscribe('statistics.emitted') do |event|
  sum = event[:statistics]['txmsgs']
  diff = event[:statistics]['txmsgs_d']

  p "Sent messages: #{sum}"
  p "Messages sent from last statistics report: #{diff}"
end

sleep(2)

# Sent messages: 0
# Messages sent from last statistics report: 0

20.times { producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: 'data') }

# Sent messages: 20
# Messages sent from last statistics report: 20

sleep(2)

20.times { producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: 'data') }

# Sent messages: 40
# Messages sent from last statistics report: 20

sleep(2)

# Sent messages: 40
# Messages sent from last statistics report: 0

producer.close
```

Note: The metrics returned may not be completely consistent between brokers, toppars and totals, due to the internal asynchronous nature of librdkafka. E.g., the top level tx total may be less than the sum of the broker tx values which it represents.

### Datadog and StatsD integration

WaterDrop comes with (optional) full Datadog and StatsD integration that you can use. To use it:

```ruby
# require datadog/statsd and the listener as it is not loaded by default
require 'datadog/statsd'
require 'waterdrop/instrumentation/vendors/datadog/listener'

# initialize your producer with statistics.interval.ms enabled so the metrics are published
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  config.deliver = true
  config.kafka = {
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'statistics.interval.ms': 1_000
  }
end

# initialize the listener with statsd client
listener = ::WaterDrop::Instrumentation::Vendors::Datadog::Listener.new do |config|
  config.client = Datadog::Statsd.new('localhost', 8125)
  # Publish host as a tag alongside the rest of tags
  config.default_tags = ["host:#{Socket.gethostname}"]
end

# Subscribe with your listener to your producer and you should be ready to go!
producer.monitor.subscribe(listener)
```

You can also find [here](https://github.com/karafka/waterdrop/blob/master/lib/waterdrop/instrumentation/vendors/datadog/dashboard.json) a ready to import DataDog dashboard configuration file that you can use to monitor all of your producers.

### Error notifications

WaterDrop allows you to listen to all errors that occur while producing messages and in its internal background threads. Things like reconnecting to Kafka upon network errors and others unrelated to publishing messages are all available under `error.occurred` notification key. You can subscribe to this event to ensure your setup is healthy and without any problems that would otherwise go unnoticed as long as messages are delivered.

```ruby
producer = WaterDrop::Producer.new do |config|
  # Note invalid connection port...
  config.kafka = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9090' }
end

producer.monitor.subscribe('error.occurred') do |event|
  error = event[:error]

  p "WaterDrop error occurred: #{error}"
end

# Run this code without Kafka cluster
loop do
  producer.produce_async(topic: 'events', payload: 'data')

  sleep(1)
end

# After you stop your Kafka cluster, you will see a lot of those:
#
# WaterDrop error occurred: Local: Broker transport failure (transport)
#
# WaterDrop error occurred: Local: Broker transport failure (transport)
```

### Forking and potential memory problems

If you work with forked processes, make sure you **don't** use the producer before the fork. You can easily configure the producer and then fork and use it.

To tackle this [obstacle](https://github.com/appsignal/rdkafka-ruby/issues/15) related to rdkafka, WaterDrop adds finalizer to each of the producers to close the rdkafka client before the Ruby process is shutdown. Due to the [nature of the finalizers](https://www.mikeperham.com/2010/02/24/the-trouble-with-ruby-finalizers/), this implementation prevents producers from being GCed (except upon VM shutdown) and can cause memory leaks if you don't use persistent/long-lived producers in a long-running process or if you don't use the `#close` method of a producer when it is no longer needed. Creating a producer instance for each message is anyhow a rather bad idea, so we recommend not to.
