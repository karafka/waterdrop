module WaterDrop
  class Producer
    # Object that acts as a proxy allowing for alteration of certain low-level per-topic
    # configuration and some other settings that users may find useful to alter, without having
    # to create new producers with their underlying librdkafka instances.
    #
    # Since each librdkafka instance creates at least one TCP connection per broker, creating
    # separate objects just to alter thing like `acks` may not be efficient and may lead to
    # extensive usage of TCP connections, especially in bigger clusters.
    #
    # This variant object allows for "wrapping" of the producer with alteration of those settings
    # in such a way, that two or more alterations can co-exist and share the same producer,
    # effectively sharing the librdkafka client.
    #
    # Since this is an enhanced `SimpleDelegator` all `WaterDrop::Producer` APIs are preserved and
    # a variant alteration can be used as a regular producer. The only important thing is to
    # remember to only close it once.
    #
    # @note Not all settings are alterable. We only allow to alter things that are safe to be
    #   altered as they have no impact on the producer. If there is a setting you consider
    #   important and want to make it alterable, please open a GH issue for evaluation.
    #
    # @note Please be aware, that variant changes also affect buffers. If you overwrite the
    #  `max_wait_timeout`, since buffers are shared (as they exist on producer level), flushing
    #   may be impacted.
    #
    # @note `topic_config` is validated when created for the first time during message production.
    #   This means, that configuration error may be raised only during dispatch. There is no
    #   way out of this, since we need `librdkafka` instance to create the references.
