    # option [Boolean] if you're producing messages faster than the framework or the network can
    #   send them off, ruby-kafka might reject them. If that happens, WaterDrop will either raise

      # option [Integer] A timeout executed by a broker when the client is sending messages to it.
      #   It defines the number of seconds the broker should wait for replicas to acknowledge the
